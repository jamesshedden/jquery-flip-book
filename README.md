# jquery flip book

> A flip book (or flick book) is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.[1]

Hello there, [I’m James](http://www.jshedden.com). I’ve made a very simple jQuery plugin to help me render flip book style animations or to create a [‘boiling’ effect](http://www.animationpost.co.uk/notes2/wobble.htm)>.

If you have several elements (eg images) of the same size within a single parent element, this plugin will automatically display them one by one, with configurable options for speed, starting point, direction and more.

Please have a look below for instructions on how to use my plugin - and if you have some ideas for making it better, get stuck in!
